This project was completed for the Correlated Data course at Macalester College, analyzing long-term effects of brain-training on cognition, specifically looking at reasoning ability in older adults.

## Abstract

This study analyses the long-term impacts of individual reasoning outcomes within the ACTIVE study using a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model. We conclude that given the frame of the study, with intermittent 'boosters' of training given, reasoning-directed training has no discernible long-term impact on the subjects' reasoning ability. It appears more likely that external outcomes relating to previous brain development have a strong impact on reasoning abilities, while failure to engage in active training will almost certainly result in reasoning decline.
