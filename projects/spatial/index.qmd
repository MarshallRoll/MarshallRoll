## Abstract

This spatial analysis investigates home values across Ramsey Countyâ€™s neighborhoods, contextualized by historical inequities in housing. Utilizing demographic and housing data from the tidycensus package and spatial autoregressive models, we examined the impact of various factors on home prices. The study identified that distance-based neighborhood structures significantly influenced home values. Results indicated persistent valuation disparities linked to past discriminatory practices, with certain
areas like Cathedral Hill deviating from broader trends. Despite these insights, the study acknowledges the limitations inherent in using estimated census data and the potential exclusion of key variables. The research underscores the need for continuous policy evaluation to address the long-term
effects of historical housing discrimination.
