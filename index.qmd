::: {#intro-heading}
Hi there! I'm Marshall Roll, a senior at Macalester College studying Applied Math & Statistics and Environmental Studies. I am particularly interested in data science and statistics and how cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning tools can be applied in new ways to shed light on environmental issues and beyond to create a more equitable world in the face of injustices. I have a passion for interdisciplinary work that seeks to combine a variety of fields and I am hoping to explore this more in a graduate school program in statistics or biostatistics.

## Education
